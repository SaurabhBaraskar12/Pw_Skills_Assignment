    "Forward propagation in a neural network serves the purpose of computing the output of the network given a set of input data. It involves passing the input data through the network's layers, where each layer applies a series of transformations (such as matrix multiplications, activation functions, and biases) to the input data to produce an output. The output generated by forward propagation is then compared to the actual target output during training to compute the loss/error, which is used to update the network's parameters (weights and biases) during the learning process. Essentially, forward propagation is the process of making predictions or inferences using the neural network."
