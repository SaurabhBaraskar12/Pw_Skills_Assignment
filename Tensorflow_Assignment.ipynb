    "Tensors: Tensors are the core data structure in TensorFlow. They are multidimensional arrays with a uniform data type. Tensors can be scalars (0-dimensional), vectors (1-dimensional), matrices (2-dimensional), or higher-dimensional arrays. They represent the inputs, outputs, and intermediate values in TensorFlow computations.\n",
    "Variables: Variables are mutable tensors that hold values which can be updated during the execution of a TensorFlow graph. They are typically used to represent model parameters that need to be optimized during training.\n",
    "Constants: Constants are immutable tensors whose values cannot be changed during execution. They are used to represent fixed inputs, hyperparameters, or other constants in a TensorFlow graph.\n",
    "Sparse Tensors: Sparse tensors are a specialized data structure used to efficiently represent tensors containing mostly zero values. They store only the non-zero elements along with their indices, which helps save memory and computation resources, especially for large-scale sparse data.\n",
    "Ragged Tensors: Ragged tensors are used to represent multi-dimensional arrays with non-uniform shapes. Unlike regular tensors where all dimensions must have the same size, ragged tensors allow for varying lengths along different dimensions. They are particularly useful for handling sequences of variable-length data, such as sentences of different lengths in natural language processing tasks."
