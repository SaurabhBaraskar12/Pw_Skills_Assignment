    "Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points together into clusters based on their inherent characteristics or features. The primary goal of clustering is to partition the data into subsets, or clusters, such that data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. The process involves identifying patterns or structures in the data without the need for labeled outcomes or target variables."
