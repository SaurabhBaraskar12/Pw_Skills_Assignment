    "Q1. What are the key features of the wine quality data set? Discuss the importance of each feature in predicting the quality of wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these features plays a crucial role in determining the overall quality and characteristics of wine. By analyzing and understanding these chemical properties, winemakers and researchers can develop models to predict and potentially improve wine quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How did you handle missing data in the wine quality data set during the feature engineering process? Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different imputation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of imputation technique depends on various factors such as the nature of the data, the extent of missingness, the presence of relationships between variables, and computational resources. It's often recommended to compare the performance of different techniques and consider the assumptions underlying each method before selecting the most appropriate approach for imputing missing data. Additionally, combining multiple imputation techniques or using ensemble methods can sometimes improve imputation accuracy and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are the key factors that affect students' performance in exams? How would you go about analyzing these factors using statistical techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "By employing these statistical techniques, researchers and educators can gain valuable insights into the factors influencing students' exam performance and develop targeted strategies to support student success. Additionally, combining quantitative analysis with qualitative methods such as interviews or surveys can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors at play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Describe the process of feature engineering in the context of the student performance data set. How did you select and transform the variables for your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "By carefully selecting and transforming variables in the student performance dataset, feature engineering can help improve the predictive power of machine learning models and uncover insights into the factors influencing\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Load the wine quality data set and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify the distribution of each feature. Which feature(s) exhibit non-normality, and what transformations could be applied to these features to improve normality?\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns\n",
    "\n",
    "wine_data = pd.read_csv('wine_quality_dataset.csv')\n",
    "\n",
    "print(wine_data.head())\n",
    "\n",
    "print(wine_data.describe())\n",
    "\n",
    "wine_data.hist(figsize=(15, 10)) plt.suptitle('Histograms of Wine Quality Dataset Features') plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.figure(figsize=(15, 10)) for i, col in enumerate(wine_data.columns): plt.subplot(4, 3, i+1) sns.kdeplot(wine_data[col], shade=True) plt.title(col) plt\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Using the wine quality data set, perform principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features. What is the minimum number of principal components required to explain 90% of the variance in the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "After running this code, n_components_90 will contain the minimum number of principal components required to explain 90% of the variance in the data. This value indicates how many principal components we can retain while still capturing the majority of the variability in the original data."
